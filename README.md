   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

After installation, you can start using the components in your projects.

## Usage üìò

To use components from My Design System, import them into your React application. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'my-design-system';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Design System</h1>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Components üß©

My Design System includes a variety of UI components that you can use in your applications. Below are some of the key components:

### Button

A customizable button component that can be styled and configured easily.

```javascript
<Button label="Submit" onClick={handleClick} />
```

### Input

npm test
```

This will execute all the tests in the project. You can also add new tests as you create new components.

### Example Test

Here‚Äôs a simple test for the Button component:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Button from './Button';

test('renders button with label', () => {
  render(<Button label="Click Me" />);
  const buttonElement = screen.getByText(/Click Me/i);
  expect(buttonElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
